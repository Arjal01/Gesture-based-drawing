🖐️ Finger Drawing with Erase Gesture using OpenCV & MediaPipe
This project implements a gesture-based virtual drawing application using OpenCV and MediaPipe Hands in Python. It allows the user to draw on the screen by raising a single index finger, and to erase parts of the drawing by raising all five fingers.

📌 Features
✍️ Drawing Mode: Activated when only the index finger is raised.

🧽 Eraser Mode: Triggered when all 5 fingers are raised.

🧠 Gesture Recognition: Uses landmark detection from MediaPipe to interpret finger positions.

🔁 Clear Screen: Press c to clear the entire drawing.

❌ Exit: Press q to quit the application.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

OpenCV: For camera capture and rendering the drawing in real time.

MediaPipe Hands: For accurate hand and finger tracking.
